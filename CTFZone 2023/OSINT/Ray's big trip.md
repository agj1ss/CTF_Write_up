# Challenge:
5 years ago, Ray the hamster flew to see the world and bought a random plane ticket. Where he went can be found on the scoreboard at gate C15 at the airport.

Flag format: ctfzone{destination}

Note: the flag is case sensitive

# Solution:
The challenge gave me an image with `.heic` format, so I converted to `.jpg` to make it easier to upload to tools:

I uploaded this to `Google Lens` and after selecting every corner of this image, I found an image in Flickr that has similar buildings from afar like the given image:

And this location is LaGuardia Airport in New York:

The challenge mentioned about `gate C15`, so I tried to google it:

And there was a result quite below mentioned about it that I captured above, so I clicked on it and it has the exact location with minimap on it too:

So I using Google Maps to the Terminal C of the airport, and using the only Google Street View that available at Terminal C and voilÃ :

There were two flights on the screen, so I tried to enter the one on the left

And we get the flag ðŸš©
