# Challenge:
Hamster Lenya moved to a new apartment. Look at the view from his window. Determine where Lenya lives. The response came in the format ctfzone{md5(00.0000,00.0000)} (Lat and Long with 4 digits after the decimal point, md5 digest in lower case)

# Solution:
The challenge gave me a picture of a building:

I Upload this to `Google Lens` and found the building with its name "Cirkon Dental Lab" in a Facebook post:

The post's given me the address already so I entered the address into `Google Maps` to find the exact latitude and longitude:

According to the angle of the given image, I have pinned the assumed location of Lenya's apartment:

The flag came with the format `ctfzone{md5(00.0000,00.0000)}` so I used an online MD5 hash generator and used latitude and longitude that I had pinned in Google Maps to create the hash:

And we get the flag ðŸš©
